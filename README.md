# Tic Tac Toe

This is an unbeatable game of tic-tac-toe. The human player can either start the game by changing to the 'O' team (the AI will be 'X' and make a move) or simply making a move by clicking on a cell on the board.

## Getting Started

Check out the [live demo](https://ryanjmack.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)!

## Built With

* HTML/SCSS
* ES6 JavaScript
* Gulp for automating tasks
* Babel for converting ES6 to ES5
* No JS or CSS libraries

## Objectives
This project is one of the advanced front end projects for freeCodeCamp.

The three user stories that must be fulfilled are:
1. I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
2. My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
3. I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.


My personal objectives for this project were:

1. Use no JavaScript libraries or frameworks
2. Structure my JS using MVC. Multiple files were used to maintain a separation of concerns.
3. Use a constructor function and prototype methods to encapsulate data and associated methods.
4. Make my tic tac toe game unbeatable using the minimax algorithm and optimizing the algorithm using alpha-beta pruning.
5. Try to ensure my code is well commented and readable.
6. Refrain from using any CSS/JS libraries or frameworks.

## Final Thoughts

This project was pretty challenging but overall I had fun and it was a great learning experience!

This project wasn't massive by any means but I iteratively keep getting better and better at approaching my work. While I planned out certain parts of my projects there were a couple of areas that I [unknowingly] neglected to address. I will continue to strive to fully understand the problem I am trying to solve and plan my work more thoroughly in the future.

I also would like to learn more about design and architecture. While I separated my scss and JS in to multiple partial files, and adopted the MVC approach I feel like I can still improve in this area. Just like Haverbeke said in *Eloquent JavaScript*, "The art of programming is the skill of controlling
complexity. The great program is subduedâ€”made simple in its complexity."
